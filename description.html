            forget a huge economic backbone. Nations internal security is one of the vital aspect in
            determining the stability and prosperous of the country. Even though there are various
            mechanism and departments working around the clock to maintain harmony in the country

            which may compromised not only the security system but also in the economic activities of the
            country. Owing to Nepal varying geographical terrain and difficulty level of continuous
            monitoring by human personal it makes a sense to utilize the technology which can restlessly

          <p class="textJustify abstractContent">
            Owing to Nepalâ€™s economy and development the defense budget, Human resource, Training
            facilities and many other aspects might not be adequate if solo human based approach is taken.
            The alternate is to use the affordable technology which can be a great tool for preventing such
            unauthorized activates.
            <br>
            This projects aims to demonstrate the ability to detect and monitor the intrusion and other
            illegal activities by using the sensors and controllers. The scope of the project is wide and can
            be utilized by various stakeholders in hierarchy. The defense, Police, Social Security and even
